            Did you find any interesting pattern? As per Wisconsin Public Radio, Wisconsin is considered one of the poorest states for racial disparities.<sup><a href = "https://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-considered-one-worst-states-racial-disparities">1</a></sup> The discrepancies span across education, income, and unemployment. Furthermore, the racial gap is established by the Gini index (1 - high inequality, 0 - high equality). <sup><a href = "https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income-inequality/about/metrics/gini-index.html">2</a></sup> Furthermore, parameters like Rented households and households without vehicles add better validation. Interestingly, the aforementioned factors resulted in Wisconsin's waning population growth.<sup><a href = "https://www.forward-analytics.net/research/slowing-down-wisconsins-waning-population-growth/">3</a></sup> Except for Milwaukee, there is sparse growth in urban counties <sup><a href = "https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/wish/urban-rural.htm">4</a></sup> like Dane, Brown, and Ozaukee. Therefore, there is no natural population growth in 29 rural counties of Wisconsin. The data is from American Community Survey (ACS) 2016-20.
